# Escape Room
Digital Escape room! Solve all the challenges before the time runs out.. ☠️

## Theme
To be decided..

## Proposed tech-stack
A micro-frontend solution where different challenges can be built in different technologies. For example: one challenge could be built with React while another one is built using svelte. My suggestion is to use `nx` for a monorepo micro-frontend architecture. Use a `node.js` server running `socket.io` or native `websockets` to enable multiplayer capabalities. Use trunk based development as source-control branching model.
